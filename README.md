## Projects

### 1. Organic Grocery Price Prediction (ECOHUB)
- **Problem:** Predict prices of organic grocery items based on product type, weight, demand trends, and market conditions.  
- **Approach:** Data cleaning, handling missing values/outliers, EDA to identify key factors. Compared Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Built full ML pipeline including preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and evaluation.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Outcome:** Random Forest achieved the best performance (lowest RMSE/MAE), enabling accurate price predictions for farmers and consumers.  

### 2. Waste Classification Using CNN
- **Problem:** Classify waste as organic or recyclable using image data.  
- **Approach:** Developed CNN with data augmentation for generalization, converted to TensorFlow Lite for deployment. Integrated into a Streamlit web app for real-time classification.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Streamlit  
- **Outcome:** Achieved **96.78% accuracy**, enabling efficient, real-time waste sorting.

### 3. Smart Adaptive Traffic Signal
- **Problem:** Optimize traffic flow and prioritize emergency vehicles and pedestrians in urban areas.  
- **Approach:** YOLOv8 for real-time vehicle/pedestrian detection, Dynamic Time Scaling for lane traffic, Priority Queue Scheduling for emergencies. Inter-lane IoT communication to redistribute green light duration. Deployed with ESP32 and relay-based traffic lights.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, OpenCV, YOLOv8, ESP32  
- **Outcome:** Reduced waiting time, improved traffic efficiency, and enhanced road safety.
